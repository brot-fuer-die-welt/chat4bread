# Chat4Bread

Chat4Bread is a hackathon prototype by Jannik Peters, Mirko Krause and Wenzel PÃ¼nter trying to help local farmers in Cameroon with
selling their goods through a SMS-based chatbot marketplace. This reduces the entry barriers for basic commericial activities.

> This is the second iteration of the initial project. It does some major design changes to
> support the testing process and removes dependencies to Twilio which caused financial losses
> at the developers side. Instead, Telegram bots will be used to simulate the SMS behavior.
